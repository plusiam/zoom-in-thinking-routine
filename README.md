# Zoom In Interactive Worksheet

This project provides a Google Apps Script template that gradually reveals sections of an image to guide students through the "Zoom In" thinking routine. Teachers can upload their own images and share a single web link with students for an interactive activity.

## Deploying the Apps Script Template
1. Open the template in Google Apps Script and choose **File → Make a copy** to add it to your Drive.
2. In your copy, upload each image you want revealed to the accompanying Google Drive folder.
3. Select **Deploy → New deployment** and follow the prompts to deploy the script as a web app.
4. After deployment, copy the URL provided—this is the link you will share with students.

## Instructions for Students
1. Open the link from your teacher.
2. Observe the portion of the image that appears and record your thoughts.
3. Click **Next** to reveal the following section and continue noting new ideas.
4. Continue until all image sections have been viewed and discussed.
