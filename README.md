# Zoom In Thinking Routine

This project contains a prototype implementation of the **Zoom In** thinking routine using Google Apps Script. The repository includes simple HTML templates for students and teachers along with a minimal server-side script (`Code.gs`).

Files:

- `Code.gs` – server-side logic to serve pages and record responses
- `StudentWorksheet.html` – student interface with incremental image reveal and response form
- `TeacherDashboard.html` – basic teacher page to store a spreadsheet ID
- `styles.css` – shared styling

These files can be uploaded to a Google Apps Script project to experiment with the Zoom In routine in a digital setting.
