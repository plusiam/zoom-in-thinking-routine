# Zoom-In Thinking Routine

This repository contains a minimal example of the "Zoom-In" thinking routine, a strategy that reveals information piece by piece so learners can examine each portion carefully. The routine invites participants to describe what they notice, make inferences, and adjust their thinking as more of an image or text becomes visible.

## Purpose

The Zoom-In routine slows down the observation process and helps students practice careful looking and reasoning from evidence. By pausing after each reveal, learners consider how new details change their interpretations and generate questions or connections.

## Using the HTML Page

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. The file is intentionally simple. Customize it with your own images or sections of text that will be uncovered step by step. After each reveal, discuss or write down what you see and how it alters your ideas.

## Setup / Deployment

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. No build tools are required. Simply open `index.html` locally or host it on any static web server (e.g. GitHub Pages) to share with others.
3. Modify `index.html` to incorporate your content or additional instructions.

Feel free to adapt this project to fit your specific Zoom-In activity.
